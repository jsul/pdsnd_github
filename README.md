### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project was created while learning the basics of Python in
Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree.
This project used bike share system data from three major cities
in the United States-Chicago, New York City, and Washington from
01/2017 through 06/2017.  

The bikeshare.py script interacts with the user by asking them which city they would like to see data from.  It also asks the user if they would like to filter the data by month or day.  The script then displays summary statistics based on the user's input.

### Files used
* bikeshare.py - interactive python script
* chicago.csv - CSV file containing bike share data from Chicago
* washington.csv - CSV file containing bike share data from       Washington
* new_york_city.csv - CSV containing bike share data from New York City

### Credits
Thank you to Udacity for walking me through both the python script and how to get the project on GitHub!
